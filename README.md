# dev-setup

This script currently only works on **MacOS** and primarily utilizes [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install applications. I do plan to make this OS agnostic in the future.

I created this to have a quick and easy way for me to set my development environment on any fresh new computer, so I can get to coding faster 😝🥷🏻👩🏼‍💻. Happy coding!

Please run the following command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluteroute/dev-setup/main/setup-macOS.sh | /bin/bash
```
